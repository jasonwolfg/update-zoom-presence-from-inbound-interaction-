  This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint explains how to set up Genesys Cloud and Zoom for a Genesys Cloud agent's Zoom presence to be updated upon the start and end of an inbound Genesys Cloud voice interaction. When an architect workflow receives an inbound interaction, a Zoom API call will be sent to the Zoom user associated with the Genesys Cloud agent assigned to the interaction.  The Zoom user's presence will be set to "On a Call" when the voice interaction begins.  When the interaction ends, the Zoom user will be returned to "Available".

  This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint explains how to set up Genesys Cloud and Zoom for a Genesys Cloud agent's Zoom presence to be updated upon the start and end of an inbound Genesys Cloud voice interaction. When an architect workflow receives an inbound interaction, a Zoom API call will be sent to the Zoom user associated with the Genesys Cloud agent assigned to the interaction.  The Zoom user's presence will be set to "On a Call" when the voice interaction begins.  When the interaction ends, the Zoom user will be returned to "Available".
The following illustration shows the presence solution from an agentâ€™s point of view.

To create a custom role, see the Custom roles information in [Roles and permissions overview](https://help.mypurecloud.com/?p=24360 "Opens the Roles and Permission overview article").
   :::

   ![Set up OAuth client](images/2BOAuthClientSetup.png "Select custom role and the grant type for client details")

3. Click **Save** and record the Client ID and Client Secret values for later use.

   ![OAuth client credentials](images/2COAuthClientCredentials.png "Copy the client ID and secret values of the OAuth client")

### Import the Update Zoom User Presence Action
This data action calls the Microsoft Graph API to update the Zoom user's presence.

1. Download the *Update-Zoom-User-Presence.custom.json* file from the [update-zoom-presence-from-inbound-interaction repo](https://github.com/jasonwolfg/update-zoom-presence-from-inbound-interaction- "Opens the GitHub repo") GitHub repository. Save this file in your local desktop to import it into Genesys Cloud.
2. Navigate to **Integrations** > **Actions** and click **Import**.

   ![Import the data action](images/4AImportDataActions.png "Import the data action")

3. Select the *Update-Zoom-User-Presence.custom.json* file and associate with the web services data action you created in the [Add a web services data actions integration](#add-a-web-services-data-actions-integration "Goes to the Add a web services data actions integration section") section and click **Import Action**.

   ![Import the Update Zoom User Presence data action](images/5BImportUpdateZoomUserPresenceDataAction.png "Import the data action")

### Import the Architect Workflows
You need to import the *GC User Set Zoom to DoNotDisturb_v8-0.i3WorkFlow* and *GC User Set Zoom to Available_v4-0.i3WorkFlow* architect workflows that references the created data actions. These workflows will be called by the Event Orchestration triggers created in the next step.  When triggered, these workflows will call the Find Zoom User ID data action, set the Zoom User Id variable then update the Zoom user's presence via the Graph API.  One workflow is triggered with an agent joins an inbound acd voice interaction and sets the Zoom presence to DoNotDisturb.  The other workflow is triggered when the inbound acd interaction ends and sets the Zoom presence to Available.  

1. Download the *GC User Set Zoom to DoNotDisturb_v8-0.i3WorkFlow* file from the [update-zoom-presence-from-inbound-interaction](https://github.com/jasonwolfg/update-zoom-presence-from-inbound-interaction- "Opens the GitHub repo") GitHub repository. Save this file to your local desktop to import it into Genesys Cloud.  

2. Navigate to **Admin** > **Architect** > **Flows:Workflow** and click **Add**.

   ![Import the script](images/AddWorkflow1.png "Add Workflow")

3. Name your workflow and click **Create**.

  ![Name your workflow](images/NameWorkflow1.png "Name your Workflow")

4. Expand the **Save** menu and click **Import**.

   ![Import Your Workflow](images/ImportWorkflow1.png "Import Your Workflow")

5. Select the downloaded *GC User Set Zoom to DoNotDisturb_v8-0.i3WorkFlow* file.  Click **Import**.

   ![Import your Workflow File](images/SelectWorkflow1ImportFile.png "Import your Workflow File")

6. Review your workflow.  Copy the workflow ID from the URL and save it for the Event Orchestration Trigger creation.  Click **Save** then click **Publish**.

   ![Save your Workflow](images/ImportedWorkflow1.png "Save Your Workflow")

7. Download the *GC User Set Zoom to Available_v4-0.i3WorkFlow* file from the [update-zoom-presence-from-inbound-interaction](https://github.com/jasonwolfg/update-zoom-presence-from-inbound-interaction- "Opens the GitHub repo") GitHub repository. Save this file to your local desktop to import it into Genesys Cloud.  

8. Navigate to **Admin** > **Architect** > **Flows:Workflow** and click **Add**.

  ![Import the script](images/AddWorkflow1.png "Add Workflow")

9. Name your workflow and click **Create**.

 ![Name your workflow](images/NameWorkflow2.png "Name your Workflow")

10. Expand the **Save** menu and click **Import**.

  ![Import Your Workflow](images/ImportWorkflow2.png "Import Your Workflow")

11. Select the downloaded *GC User Set Zoom to Available_v4-0.i3WorkFlowIâ€™m * file.  Click **Import**.

  ![Import your Workflow File](images/SelectWorkflow2ImportFile.png "Import your Workflow File")

12. Review your workflow.  Copy the workflow ID from the URL and save it for the Event Orchestration Trigger creation.  Click **Save** then click **Publish**.

  ![Save your Workflow](images/ImportedWorkflow2.png "Save Your Workflow")

## Create the Event Orchestration Triggers
With the workflows created, the last step is to create the triggers to call the workflows.  For this, you will need Event Orchestration activated in your Genesys Cloud organization and you will need Postman running on your machine to make the necessary API calls to create the necessary Event Orchestration triggers.

1. Download the *Genesys Cloud Event Orchestration Trigger API's.postman_collection.json* file from the [update-zoom-presence-from-inbound-interaction](https://github.com/jasonwolfg/update-zoom-presence-from-inbound-interaction- "Opens the GitHub repo") GitHub repository. Save this file to your local desktop to import it into Genesys Cloud.

2. Navigate to Postman and **Import**

   ![Import Event Orchestration API Collection](images/ImportPostmanCollection.png "Import Event Orchestration API Collection")

3. Locate the *Genesys Cloud Event Orchestration Trigger API's.postman_collection.json* and click **Import**

   ![Import Event Orchestration API Collection File](images/ImportPostmanCollectionFile.png "Import Event Orchestration API Collection File")


4. Expand the **Genesys Cloud Event Orchestration API's** folder and select **Genesys Cloud Client Credential Token Creation**.  Be sure to change your API domain to match the AWS region your Genesys Cloud organization is hosted.  The GC org in this screenshot is hosted in us-east-1.  On the **Authorization** tab, paste the **Client ID** from your OAuth client created in [Create an OAuth client for use with the Genesys Cloud data action integration](#create-an-oauth-client-for-use-with-the-genesys-cloud-data-action-integration "Goes to the Create an OAuth client for use with the Genesys Cloud data action integration section") in the **Username** field in Postman.  Paste the **Client Secret** from the same OAuth client into the **Password** field in Postman.  Click **Send**.
